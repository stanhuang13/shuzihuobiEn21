          <p><span style="text-decoration:none;">What is mining?</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Mining is a process of adding transaction records to the Bitcoin’s public ledger, called the Blockchain. It exists so that every transaction can be confirmed, and every single user of the network can access this ledger. It is also used to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts at re-spending money that has already been spent somewhere else.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Essentially, miners are serving the Bitcoin community by confirming every transaction and making sure that every single one of them is legitimate. Every time a new block is ‘sealed off’, a miner gets a reward. As of October 2017, the bounty stands at 12.5 Bitcoins per block.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">The rate at which new coins appear resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground. Hence why the process is called ‘mining’.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Read more in the article “What Is Bitcoin Mining”</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">How to choose hardware for mining</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hash rate</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Considering the complexity that is involved in mining Bitcoins, it’s very important to invest in the right kind of hardware. There are a few characteristics to consider when choosing the equipment that will best suit you, and one of them is hash rate.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hash rate is the number of calculations that your hardware can perform every second. It is a very important parameter, as a higher hash rate will obviously increase your chances of solving the mathematical problem, sealing off the block and collecting your reward.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">What miners are looking for is a specified output of the hash function. When it comes to hash functions, the same input will always produce the same output, but they are designed to be unpredictable. So, the best possible way to find a specific output is to try as many random inputs as possible. Moreover, mining is very competitive, so in order to collect a reward, the miner will need to be able to go through those random inputs as quickly as possible. Hence why choosing hardware with higher hash rate is extremely important for successful mining.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hash rates are measured in megahashes per second (MH/sec), gigahashes per second (GH/sec) and terahashes per second (TH/sec). The hash rate of hardware that was specifically designed for mining Bitcoins can range from 336 MH/s to 14,000,000 MH/s.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Energy consumption</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Bitcoin mining hardware is an investment, and as such it has some associated costs. The more powerful your hardware is, the more electricity it is going to require. Before making a purchase, you need to consider your desired hardware’s electricity consumption in watts and work out how much more expensive your next electricity bill is going to be. You wouldn’t want to spend all your money on electricity to mine coins that won’t even be worth what you paid.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">You can use hash rate and energy consumption numbers to work out how many hashes you will be getting for every watt of electricity used by your hardware. To do this, you need to simply divide the hash count by the number of watts. For example, if your hardware’s hash rate is 4,500 MH/s and it requires 32 watts of power, then you will be getting 140,625 MH/s per watt. You can use an online electricity price calculator or just check your power bill to figure out how much it is going to cost you in hard cash.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">In some cases you will be using your computer to run the mining hardware. Obviously, your computer will have its own electricity draw on top of what mining hardware chews up, so you will need to factor that into your calculations.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hardware for mining</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">In the early days of Bitcoin, many people were drawn to it, because to them it was a revolutionary and liberating idea. Indeed, a decentralized, self-governing network where ordinary users were in charge of ensuring that the transactions will go through was a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by banks, tax authorities and massive corporations keeping an eye on how people spend their own money. Back then, Bitcoin’s value was nowhere near what it is today. So, a lot of miners were motivated by the idea of Bitcoin and not just profit. They were able to generate hash sequences and confirm transaction using powerful enough computers and even laptops.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">At some point, miners discovered that high-end graphics cards had the potential of significantly increasing Bitcoin mining power. Those graphics cards consumed far less power per unit of work, and the results were 50 to 100 times better than before. Subsequently, dedicated mining devices were introduced. They increased mining capabilities five-fold, which allowed for the fist mining farms to be constructed at an operational profit, and paved the way for the Bitcoin mining industry.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">These days, Bitcoin mining has turned into a lucrative business. There are many people now who pay their bills by operating massive Bitcoin mining farms. These farms are assembled using various mining hardware, as well as graphics cards and coolers. Obviously, they require a lot of electricity in order to operate, so access to cheap power becomes paramount. It is the cheap electricity that made Chinese Bitcoin mining farms so profitable.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;"><br></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration:none;">Those wishing to make some money on Bitcoin mining will need to compete against worldwide corporations with virtually unlimited resources to spend on mining farms, as well as hundreds of individual miners joining their forces and forming mining pools.</span></p>
